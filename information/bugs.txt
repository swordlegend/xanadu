-------------------- critical/blocking bugs --------------------

-

-------------------- map and map life stuff (mobs, reactors, portals) --------------------

- fix monster spawn rate (make use of mobRate info from maps) and check the correct timer seconds

- fix reactors (need reactor objects system in maps, the map reactor data is already done)

- drops (from mobs or from player) fly a bit weird when spawned

- meso drops missing, non-optimal workaround in place at the moment

- fix party exp (Mob::give_exp function at the bottom, check the formula)

- to-do prevent loading or displaying of maple tv's and turkey mobs

- to-do time-mobs (mobs/bosses that spawn in specific maps in specific times, for example hourly spawn of orange mushroom in it's map)

- fix other players dont see damage taken from character

- fix other players can loot drops immidiatly when monster killed by other without being in a party

- fix pet mesos/equip pickup: need to make a difference between drops by mobs (lootable by pet) and players (not lootable by pet) in the packet

- to-do debuffing/monster/boss skills? statusses need to be implemented
NOTES:
need to work out the details of these features first

-------------------- skills --------------------

- fix door skill (bishop)

- fix mist skills (poison mist and so on by mages)

- fix pirate skills

- fix other skills that do not fully work yet

- fix player summontimer

-------------------- npcs --------------------

- fix storage npcs (use the correct id's in player.cpp in the npc function)

- to-do npc interactions? maybe needs to be coded

-------------------- hired merchants --------------------

- to-do fix hired merchant when store owner enters merchant for maintenance, it needs to be shown in the map on the merchant

- to-do fix hired merchant when disconnecting while setting up a hired merchant, the items in it are lost

- to-do fix hired merchant when owner of store takes out item it doesnt get back into inventory

- to-do fix when closing hired merchant, items are stored, but it seems that amount of items stays at 1, so if multiple items were put it, some are lost

-------------------- bugs --------------------

- to-do fix cash shop inventory 

- to-do fix pet food

- to-do fix pet fullness

- to-do fix the monster carnival and energy send headers

- to-do fix target character doesn't get buddy invite after logging in if someone sent buddy request while he was offline

- to-do fix sender character doesn't get notification if the target declined the buddy invite (not sure if this is a bug)

- to-do fix buddy's don't get the info that player changed channel

- to-do fix when buddy is deleted, the buddy still see's the deleter as online (not sure if this is a bug)

- to-do fix when trying to fame/defame someone within the blocked time, it says try again later instead of the correct message (not sure if this is a bug)

- to-do fix when trade invite is declined, the inviter gets no notification about that (not sure if this is a bug)

- to-do fix when party invite is declined, the inviter gets no notification about that (not sure if this is a bug)

- to-do fix inventory item merging and sorting, make it properly work (at the moment it's only item sorting)

- to-do fix handle_pet_command in pet_handler
 
- to-do fix handle_pet_chat in pet_handler
 
- to-do fix handle_pet_loot in pet_handler

-------------------- other --------------------

- to-do maybe change guild data loading and saving (right now its loaded at server startup from mysql, then kept in ram, then saved to mysql but only when doing a proper shutdown)

- to-do maybe use multiple worker threads for asynchronous operations (requires code to be correct for multithreading, for example by using locks and atoms and designing it that way)

- to-do maybe set cash items to max one item per slot (not sure if that has to be that way)

- to-do re-write logger (probably based on C++ stream functionality) and use it in exceptions

- to-do maybe make acceptor asynchronous

- to-do apply design rules like function naming convention

- to-do make correct use of const and reference usage and passing

- make sure guild master cannot delete his character (need check at character deletion)? or atleast prevent guild messing up due to that

- INFO: look up odinms based repacks how they load info from wz xmls which are simply extracts from .wz files, this will help to make proper use of .wz files

- to-do check and improve .wz loading code also by consulting odinms based repacks on how they did it
